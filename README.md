# Convolutional Neural Networks

## Purpose of Plan
An architectural firm proposes the
following simplified problem:
“find the building with the largest
floor area contained in the given
parcel”.
It is a Mathematical problem to
build an approximation algorithm
for finding the largest rectangle
inside a non-convex polygon.

## QickView

```python
Instruction

1.	Execute the files pro_pso.py to visualize the Particle Swarm Optimization
2.	Execute the files pro_ta.py to visualize the Taboo Search Optimization

visualizations
    -- rectangular plot fit
    -- convergence to max distance over time

The ipynb files contain the code for running th entire script to visualize the
    -- 30 runs of each algorithm(PSO & TABU Search)
    -- Comparison for those 30 runs(PSO V/S TABU Search)
preferable to execute it with jupyter or google colab
the other two folders contain data obtained during these runs(screenshot of outputs PSO and TABU)
